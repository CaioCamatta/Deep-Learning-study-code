# Deep-Learning-study-code
A dump of some of the code I wrote while studying Deep Learning.

## Important
  - The purpose of this repository is to show some of the stuff I coded while studying and practicing Deep Learning at the beginning of 2018.
  - I didn't code any of this with the purpose of teaching, so it's not very well commented or well organized, but I hope some people can find the solutions for their bugs or struggles in this code. Just adding to the community.
  - A lot of the code here was influenced by tutorials and other people's implementations of DL papers. 
  - Some DL implementations may not work perfectly depending on the version of the libraries you're using.
